# Running the app
As I don't have a paid developer account, this app is not notarized. If you have issues running the app, try referring to this article -> https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/how-to-launch-any-macos-app-even-those-not-notarized-by-apple

You can download the app from Releases or build it yourself with XCode.
